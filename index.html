                    An affinity diagram for a project to help college student manage their time and responsibilites.
                    The affinity diagram has 8 clusters: Audience, Management, Needed Staff, Starting Project, Marketing/Advertising, Pricing, Interface, and Features.
                    Across these clusters, there are 24 ideas. 
                    To start, I made notes about what happened to come to mind about this idea. Then, I grouped similar ideas together and named the cluster. 
                    While completing this exercise, I realized how many different factors go into creating a project. 
                    It was interesting to see all of the different ideas go from random to an organized system.

                    Sketch 1: 
                    The homepage depicts a calendar with dots representing the number of tasks on each day. Additionally, it highlights tasks specific to the current day.<br>
                    
                    Sketch 2:
                    This is a task creation screen where users can create new tasks to organize. It includes title, deadline, priority by star system, repeat, and alerts. <br>
                    
                    Sketch 3:
                    Task Schedule contains all imported, upcoming tasksâ€”colored-coded categories with mark-as-done boxes. Ability to filter by certain parameters. AI suggestions on when to complete tasks based on priority and number of tasks.
