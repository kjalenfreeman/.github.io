                    An affinity diagram for a project to help college student manage their time and responsibilites.
                    The affinity diagram has 8 clusters: Audience, Management, Needed Staff, Starting Project, Marketing/Advertising, Pricing, Interface, and Features.
                    Across these clusters, there are 24 ideas. 
                    To start, I made notes about what happened to come to mind about this idea. Then, I grouped similar ideas together and named the cluster. 
                    While completing this exercise, I realized how many different factors go into creating a project. 
                    It was interesting to see all of the different ideas go from random to an organized system.
